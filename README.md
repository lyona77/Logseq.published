# YAML 

Each markdown-based file include a `status` field to indicate the progress of
the tutorial.

-   **In Progress:** Indicates that the tutorial is not ready for use. This
    stage is for gathering input and ongoing work. This status indicates that
    the document is being actively worked on.

-   **Complete Draft:** The tutorial may be ready for use, but is still an
    active document.

-   **Published:** The document is finalized and publishable outputs (html, pdf)
    have been generated.

-   **Archived**

-   **Obsolete**

Should major revisions be made after the tutorials are "published," add a
"version" field and print it out along with the date of updates in the output
documents.
