## Tidyverse

1.  **`ggplot2`**: Used for data visualization.
2.  **`dplyr`**: Provides a grammar for data manipulation, including filtering
    rows, selecting columns, re-arranging data, and aggregating information.
3.  **`tidyr`**: Helps in tidying your data. Its functions allow you to
    rearrange data to make it easier to analyze.
4.  **`readr`**: Designed for reading rectangular data, particularly csv and
    delimited files.
5.  **`purrr`**: Enhances Râ€™s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a
    complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors.
6.  **`tibble`**: Provides a modern reimagining of the data frame, keeping what
    time has proven effective, and throwing out what is not.
7.  **`stringr`**: Simplifies the process for string operations.
8.  **`forcats`**: Provides tools for handling categorical variables (factors).

## Useful Hadleyverse packages not included in Tidyverse

1.  **`lubridate`**: Facilitates working with dates and times.
2.  **`devtools`**/**`usethis`**: Essential for package development, providing
    various tools to facilitate the process.
3.  **`testthat`**: Designed for unit testing, making it easy to write and run
    tests for R code.
